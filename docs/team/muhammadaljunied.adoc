== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability for expenses in foreign currencies to be stored and converted*
** What it does: when an expense is added to MyMorise, the
system can automatically convert the amount specified in the expense relative to the currency that was specified in the expense. 
** Justification: This feature improves user experience significantly for managing expenses as the user no longer needs to convert a foreign currency manually back into their home(base) currency. 
** Highlights: This enhancement affects 80% of all functionality of the application as all amounts added to the system may need to be converted to ensure correct computations. This required careful planning as as soon as it is implemented, I antiticapated a large number of regressions from existing implementations as well as regressions as the other componenets of the app are implemented. The exchange rate for converting the expense's amount from its base amount to the specified currency is retreived from the exchange data and stored together with the Expense. The reason for this is to ensure that an expense retains its converted value based on the rate at the time it was added, regardless of when the computation is being done. As currecy exchange rates are non-constant data, there is a small dependence on retreiving more updated data by making an API call in the form of a HTTP GET request to a publically availale endpoint. To ensure MyMorise remains responsive while the call is made, the HTTP Request is executed asynchronously with a strict 5 second timeout (a successful request should not take longer than 5 seconds). The fallback in poor/lack of internet conditions is a pre-loaded exchange rate stored in JSON. A successful response stores the exchange rate to the file system for the next run to use if there is no internet connection in subsequent runs, which mitigates conversion-error margins slightly.

** Credits: _The idea to add it came from a "if I was using this app" brainstorming session, however I must credit Budgeting/Finance Apps I had donloaded on Android that I played around, specifically http://wally.me/[WallyNext]_
