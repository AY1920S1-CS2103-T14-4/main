== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added the ability to create/edit and delete budgets
** What it does: allows the user to better manage their expenses by having customizable budgets to track their expenses for them.
** Justification: This feature is fundamental in an application that tracks expenses.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis on every aspect of the app and design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: AddressBook Level 3

* *Minor enhancements*: Updated certain existing commands to work well with the major enhancement without creating separate commands. Example: Delete command will be able to delete an expense or a budget depending on what the user is viewing instead of creating a separate DeleteBudget command.
