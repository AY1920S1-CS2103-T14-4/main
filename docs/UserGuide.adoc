== Introduction

MYMorise -- Manage Your Money is a desktop application for those who *prefer tracking personal expenses on his
computer*.
More importantly, MYMorise is *optimized for those
who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface
(GUI). If you can type fast, PEM can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
